             <p>I am a <a href="https://neurotree.org/beta/tree.php?pid=57149&fontsize=1&pnodecount=4&cnodecount=2" 
             target="_blank"><strong>neuroscientist</strong></a>  and tool developer with a passion for creating products 
             that make data analysis methods more accessible, interpretable, and reusable.</p>
            
            
            <p>I am currently the senior director of data products and analytics at 
                <a href="https://www.inscopix.com" target="_blank"><strong>Inscopix</strong></a>
            (a <a href="https://www.brukercom" target="_blank">Bruker</a> company), 
            where I oversee groups of computational scientists, data engineers, and 
            software engineers who work together to create software products for enabling 
            and accelerating neuroscience research.</p>
            
            <p> My previous industry experiences 
            include architecting a machine learning software product to improve preclinical 
            rodent behavior screening (<a href="https://www.blackboxbio.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Blackbox Bio</strong></a>), 
            working as a senior data scientist
            to create data products that government and healthcare authorities 
            use to drive policy decision making (<a href="https://forwardplatform.com/" target="_blank"><strong>LiveStories</strong></a>, 
            now FORWARD), and advising as a 
          machine learning product consultant for a variety of start-ups 
            (with <a href="https://www.madronavl.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Madrona Venture Labs</strong></a>).</p> 
            
            <p>In academia, I was an early member of <a href="https://brianchenlab.mcgill.ca/#/home" target="_blank"><strong>Brian Chen’s lab</a> 
                at McGill</strong>, where I investigated how 
                PlexinA and PlexinB mediate synaptic targeting in fruit flies. 
                I went on to pursue at <a href="https://pinphd.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank"> <strong>PhD in neuroscience at Harvard</strong></a>, 
                where I joined <a href="https://sabatini.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank"><strong>Bernardo Sabatini’s lab</strong></a>.
                 My graduate studies began with using single-cell slice electrophysiology to elucidate how endogenous 
                 opioid peptides sculpt neural activity in the basal ganglia (mostly dorsal striatum, in mice). 
                 Building on this work, I moved <i>in vivo</i> to better understand how these same opioid-sensitive 
                 circuits are involved in reward-based decision making. This involved training mice to perform 
             <p>So far my career has looked something like the following ‘<i>in logos</i>’:</p>
