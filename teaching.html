                <p class="article-summary"> Vancouver BC | From 2023-25 I was involved with Science World's "Scientists and Innovators in Schools" program, where I gave
                    talks at elementary and secondary schools around the lower mainland. The content varied by grade, but was usually something neuroscience related. 
                    One of my favourite topics was discussing how we discovered the brain 'is electric', starting with Galvani and Volta.

                <p class="article-summary"> Seattle WA | From 2017-19 I volunteered at the Bureau of Fearless Ideas (FBI), a non-profit organization for 
                    people ages 6-18 focused on inspiring and cultivating the power of words and writing. I worked primarily with 6-10 year olds and got to help them discover how to tell their own stories, and how to 
                    learn through listening to other's stories.
