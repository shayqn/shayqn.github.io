                <p class="article-summary"> Vancouver BC | Since 2023 I've been involved in Science World's "Scientists and Innovators in Schools" program, where I get matched to give 
                    guest talks at local elementary and secondary schools. The content varies by grade and depending on what the students are currently learning, but it's usually something neuroscience related. 
                    One of my favourite topics is discussing how we discovered the brain 'is electric', starting with Galvani and Volta.

                <p class="article-summary"> Seattle WA | From 2017-19 I volunteered at the Bureau of Fearless Ideas (FBI), a non-profit organization for 
                    people ages 6-18 focused on inspiring and cultivating the power of words and writing. I worked primarily with 6-10 year olds and got to help them discover how to tell their own stories, and how to 
                    learn through listening to other's stories.
